I helped deliver a straightforward talk on the paper FloorPlan-LLaMa: Aligning Architectsâ€™ Feedback and Domain Knowledge in Architectural Floor Plan Generation. This work focuses on using AI to improve floor plan design by incorporating architects' feedback and expertise.

## The Poster Session

We also showcased a poster summarizing the research, allowing for direct interactions and feedback. 
ACL 2025 was inspiring, and I'm glad to have supported this project.
