From **December 7–10, 2025**, **SIGIR-AP 2025** was held in **Xi’an, China**. As one of the organizers, I co-organized the **BREV-RAG workshop** — **Beyond Relevance-based EValuation of RAG systems** — at SIGIR-AP 2025.

### Why BREV-RAG?
Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is often dominated by *relevance-focused* criteria (e.g., relevance, correctness, groundedness). However, real-world RAG deployments demand a broader view of quality: reliability, responsibility, usefulness, and other dimensions that are not fully captured by traditional relevance-centric evaluation.  
**BREV-RAG** aims to advance this discussion and encourage more comprehensive, actionable evaluation protocols for RAG systems.

### What we did at the workshop
- We accepted and presented **5 papers** in the first half of the session.
- The second half focused on **group discussions**, using the accepted papers as “seed materials” to explore new evaluation axes and practical methodologies beyond relevance-based metrics.
- We plan to consolidate the workshop outcomes and report them.
