Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) integrated with external tools and APIs have successfully addressed complex tasks by using in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite this progress, the vast scale of tool retrieval remains challenging due to stringent input length constraints. In response, we propose a pre-retrieval strategy from an extensive repository, effectively framing the problem as the massive tool retrieval (MTR) task. We introduce the MTRB (massive tool retrieval benchmark) to evaluate real-world tool-augmented LLM scenarios with a large number of tools. This benchmark is designed for low-resource scenarios and includes a diverse collection of tools with descriptions refined for consistency and clarity. It consists of three subsets, each containing 90 test samples and 10 training samples. To handle the low-resource MTR task, we raise a new query-tool alignment (QTA) framework leverages LLMs to enhance query-tool alignment by rewriting user queries through ranking functions and the direct preference optimization (DPO) method. This approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in top-5 and top-10 retrieval tasks across the MTRB benchmark, with improvements up to 93.28% based on the metric Sufficiency@k, which measures the adequacy of tool retrieval within the first k results. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the efficacy of our framework, highlighting its capacity to optimize performance even with limited annotated samples. Specifically, our framework achieves up to 78.53% performance improvement in Sufficiency@k with just a single annotated sample. Additionally, QTA exhibits strong cross-dataset generalizability, emphasizing its potential for real-world applications.
